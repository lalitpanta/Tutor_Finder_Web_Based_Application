Tutor Finder Web Application (College Minor Project)
By [Lalit Pant]

Tutor Finder is a web-based application created as part of my college minor project. Its main goal is to connect students with qualified tutors quickly, easily, and affordably. The application provides a seamless experience for students to search and interact with tutors, while ensuring that tutors can easily share their knowledge. The project uses:

HTML: For structuring the web content.
CSS: For styling the webpage elements.
JavaScript: To enable interactivity on the web application.
Node.js: As the backend for handling server-side logic and API requests.
MySQL: For storing and managing user and tutor data.
XAMPP: To simplify local development with MySQL support.
The Tutor Finder application makes the process of finding a tutor simple and headache-free. It is designed to be fast, reliable, and affordable for students seeking quality educational support.

Future Enhancements:

Display tutor availability in real-time.
Enable student ratings and feedback for tutors.
Develop a mobile app for easier access.
Integrate a payment method for convenient transactions.
Continuously add new features as needed.
This project serves as a practical implementation of web development technologies and aims to improve access to education by bridging the gap between students and tutors.
